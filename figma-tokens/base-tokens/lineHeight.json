The name normal, related to the CSS rule normal which is how this is represented in our codebase. Because Figma doesn't understand 1.2 as a unitless lineheight, we have to perform some mathematical operations. In the transformation process we can resolve this, but it currently leaves us with pixel line height values rather than unitless values."
